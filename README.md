Explanation of the Array Operations: 25+ program logic
-----------------------------------------------------

Largest number: Find the largest element using max().

Smallest number: Find the smallest element using min().

Sort array: Sort the array in ascending order using sorted().

Reverse array: Reverse the array by manually swapping elements.

Check if sorted: Compare the original array with the sorted version.

Second largest: Get the second largest element after sorting and removing duplicates.

Count occurrences: Count occurrences of a specific element (20).

Merge arrays: Merge two arrays into one.

Remove duplicates: Use distinct() to remove duplicates from an array.

Average: Find the average of array elements using average().

Multiply each element by 2: Map each element to its double.

All greater than 20: Check if all elements are greater than 20 using allMatch().

Any even number: Check if any element is even using anyMatch().

Sum of elements: Get the sum of elements using sum().

Maximum using reduce: Use reduce() to find the maximum value.

Minimum using reduce: Use reduce() to find the minimum value.

Convert to list: Convert the array to a List using boxed() and collect().

First element greater than 20: Use findFirst() to find the first element greater than 20.

Sort in descending order: Sort the array in reverse order using Comparator.reverseOrder().

Count elements greater than 30: Count the elements greater than 30.

Rotate array: Rotate the array by n positions.

Intersection of arrays: Find the common elements between two arrays.

Union of arrays: Find the union of two arrays using distinct().

Remove elements less than 20: Filter elements greater than or equal to 20.

Array of squares: Create an array containing the squares of the elements.
